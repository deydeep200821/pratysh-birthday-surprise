A very very Happy 17th Birthday! 🎉

As you step into this new year of your life, I want you to know how incredibly special you are. You have this amazing talent for weaving words into poems, but today, let me tell you—your own journey is going to be the most beautiful poetry ever written.

Whether it's your career, your dreams, or the random chaos of life, I know you will conquer it all with that goofy smile of yours. You are like a sister to me, a best friend, and someone who deserves nothing but the absolute 'Princess Treatment' from the universe.

May your future be as bright as the stars, and may you always find reasons to be happy. Keep shining, keep writing, and please... keep being the weird 'Hathi' that you are!

P.S. I coded this entire thing just for you because a simple text wouldn't do justice to our bond.

With all the love and luck,`;
